# Material-UI Auto Top-up

## Project Overview

Material-UI Auto Top-up is a React component designed to facilitate auto top-up functionality within a credit system. It utilizes Material UI components and TypeScript for seamless integration and enhanced user experience.

## Component Structure

The component is structured using Material-UI's `Slider`, `Switch`, `Button`, and `Typography` components, ensuring a modern and intuitive interface.

## State Management

State management is achieved through React's `useState` hook, allowing for efficient control over the auto top-up toggle and slider value. By default, the auto top-up is set to 'on', with the slider value corresponding to 1200 credits.

## Auto Top-up Functionality

The component seamlessly toggles auto top-up settings based on the state of the switch. When the switch is activated, auto top-up settings are displayed; when deactivated, they are hidden. Upon clicking the "Confirm auto-purchase" button, the selected credit amount is logged to the console.

## Styling

Material-UI's styling solution is employed to meticulously craft the component's appearance, ensuring alignment with the provided design. Attention is paid to color scheme, spacing, and typography to maintain fidelity to the design specifications.
